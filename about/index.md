# About Legacy 2345

Legacy 2345 is a sci-fi themed colony simulator.  It's the not-too-distant
future, Mother Earth reached her carrying capacity a generation ago and
humankind has been forced to move out among the stars.  The movement of both
people and information has an upper limit of the speed of light, but fortunately
'cold sleep' has almost been perfected so subjective time for an interstellar
trip is as short as a few weeks.

With the nearby resources of the solar system, building a colony ship is
relatively inexpensive.  Earth observers have compiled a list of attainable star
systems with planets demonstrating orbital mechanics and spectral emissions that
are likely to be compatible with colonization.  As captain, you simply have to
choose your target destination, hire your core crew, outfit your ship, take a
load of colonists, and go.

It's just that easy.
